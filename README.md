## Overview

Capsule Corp Labs is the official Ternoa lab. We started our activity a year ago and have supported several companies in building using Ternoa technology.

We engage in two activities. The first is building applications that help develop the Ternoa ecosystem. The second is supporting projects that choose to build using our technology.

Recently, we supported Maison Keyser, Virtual Regatta, TapNation, Time Guardian, Metafight, Mafiafoot, Cross the Ages, and around 50 other projects in one year.



## Product/Service

We are creating a Gachagacha web3 version using Ternoa technology.

Working with famous IPs from Europe and Japan, we will create two collections per month, each with nine items and one special item. In other words, each month, users can get 18 items plus a special item.

The normal items, the GACHA, are secret soul-bound tokens, and their quantity is limited to 10,000. So in total, there are a maximum of 90,000 NFTs per collection per month, resulting in a total of 180,000 NFTs because there are two collections.

The special item, the SGACHA, is also a secret NFT with special value-added, like a pass to access gifts, augmented reality, etc.

To get a Gacha, you need to get a ticket. Each ticket costs 40 Gachacoin, and each user can claim 5 $Gachacoin for free every day.

So if a user actively claims tokens for free every day, we can get three tickets per month for free, resulting in 3 out of 18 Gacha.





## Team

The Capsule Corp Labs team is in charge of development. They have already succeeded in developing the previous projects we've mentioned.
